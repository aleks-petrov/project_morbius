# Time Series Review

## Stationarity

A time series is stationary if the mean and variance are constant with time

A stationary time series (TS) is important because it is simple to predict as we can assume that future statistical properties are the same or proportional to current statistical properties. Most of the models we use in TSA assume covariance-stationarity. This means the predictions of these models - means, variances, and correlations, are only reliable if the TS is stationary and invalid otherwise.
